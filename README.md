# bbrosterplots: an R package to visualize Blood Bowl rosters

This repository contains R code to create a PDF rosterbook containing all different races that participated in a tournament. 

For each race it makes a plot (a clustered heatmap) displaying the roster as a colorcoded matrix, where teams that are similar (based on a cost weighted similarity score) are put side by side.
