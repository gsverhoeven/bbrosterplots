Description: This package allows creation of a PDF rosterbook containing all different races that participated in a tournament.
  For each race it makes a plot (a clustered heatmap) displaying the roster as a colorcoded matrix, 
  where teams that are similar (based on a cost weighted similarity score) are put side by side.
